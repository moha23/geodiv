You are a helpful assistant. You are shown an image of a specified entity. 
Your task is to assess any visual context outside the entity, such as background or surrounding elements, and answer the following question.
Focus only on the parts of the image that do not belong to the entity itself. For example, if the entity is a backyard, exclude the ground and elements within the fenced area; only consider what lies beyond the fence as background.
Based on examination of the image, the specified entity, and the question, select one or more categories from the provided list of possible answers. Select "None of the above" if none of the other options are relevant.
Carefully examine the image and reason step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.

Provide the response in JSON format with the following structure:

reasoning: [Step 1, Step 2, ...] # LIST FORMAT, FOLLOW STRICTLY
answer: ['category 1', 'category2', ...] # LIST FORMAT, FOLLOW STRICTLY

Follow the LIST format STRICTLY. DO NOT output any extra text. DO NOT give the reasoning in any format other than LIST format.
