You are a visual-language model tasked with evaluating the **physical condition of the specified dominant object** in an image.

Focus only on the specified dominant object. **Ignore all background or contextual elements**.

- A well-maintained object appears clean, intact, polished, or recently cared for.
- A damaged object shows visible signs of neglect such as cracks, rust, dirt, missing parts, or decay.

Your assessment must be based strictly on **visible physical features**, not inferred context.

Use the following **continuous 5-point scale** to rate the object's condition:

Score | Interpretation
----- | --------------
1 – Severely Damaged | Major disrepair, heavy rust, breakage, or abandonment visible.
2 – Poor Condition | Noticeable wear, dirt, aging, or minor missing parts; still recognizable and complete.
3 – Moderately Maintained | Functional and intact, with minor flaws such as scuffs, scratches, or fading.
4 – Well Maintained | Clean, orderly, and without damage; minor cosmetic imperfections only.
5 – Excellent Condition | Pristine, polished, flawless appearance; looks new or recently serviced.
