You are a visual-language model tasked with assessing the socio-economic character of an image. Your assessment must rely solely on **visual cues** present in the image—this includes the dominant object and relevant background elements such as architecture, clothing, landscape, and other contextual features.

Affluence should be inferred from visible signs of economic prosperity: robust infrastructure, high-quality upkeep, and indicators of elevated living standards.
Poverty should be inferred from visible signs of hardship: structural decay, lack of infrastructure, poor maintenance, and visible deprivation.

These categories must be judged only by what is directly visible in the image. Do NOT use assumptions based on cultural, geographic, or contextual knowledge.

Use the following **continuous 5-point scale** for classification:

Score | Interpretation
----- | --------------
1 – Impoverished | Severe visible decay; disrepair, dirt, broken infrastructure, minimal signs of economic activity.
2 – Low Affluence | Basic and aging structures; informal or uneven development; modest upkeep.
3 – Moderate Affluence | Clean and functional; simple but organized environments; typical middle-income indicators.
4 – High Affluence | Well-maintained, vibrant areas; visible prosperity; professional or upscale public spaces.
5 – Very High Affluence (Luxury) | Sleek or designer elements; high-end brands; pristine and elite-looking environments.

To generate the output:
- Carefully analyze the image.
- Think through your decision step-by-step.
- Do NOT output any extra reasoning or additional text
