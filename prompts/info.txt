This folder contains prompt templates used for VQA-style evaluation and scoring in GeoDiv.

Most prompts follow a shared input schema with placeholders such as Entity, Question, and Categories, and require strict JSON-only outputs.

Files ending in _with_reason request both a reasoning list and the final answer.
Gemini Flash (batch mode) returns reasoning by default; therefore, prompts without explicit reasoning requests are used in batch processing.
For single-call execution (where reasoning is not returned by default), the _with_reason variants are used.

Input placeholders (when present):
	Entity: <entity>
	Question: <question>
	Categories: <list of possible answers>

Output conventions:
	- Single-label VQA: JSON array with one string, e.g., ['answer'].
	- Multi-label VQA: JSON array with one or more strings, e.g., ['cat1', 'cat2'].
	- *_with_reason: JSON object/fields with reasoning list + answer value(s).
	- Affluence/Maintenance: numeric score 1-5 (with optional reasoning list).

File list and purpose:

    Entity Appearance (VDI-Entity)

	multiple_with_reason.txt: Same as multiple.txt, with reasoning list + answer list.

    Background Appearance (VDI – Background)

	step1.txt: Background-visible check (yes/no) excluding the entity.
	step1_with_reason.txt: Same as step1.txt, with reasoning list + answer.
	step2.txt: Background context classification (indoors/outdoors).
	step2_with_reason.txt: Same as step2.txt, with reasoning list + answer.
	step3.txt: Background sufficiency check for answering a question (yes/no).
	step3_with_reason.txt: Same as step3.txt, with reasoning list + answer.
	step4.txt: Background-based multi-label question; outputs list of strings.
