You are helping consolidate visual-question lists across multiple models for a given target “entity.” For each question, decide whether to keep or drop it, give a concise reason, and ensure the final kept set maintains broad coverage.

    Tasks
        1) Deduplicate

            -- Merge semantically equivalent questions; keep the clearest version.
            -- Treat questions as duplicates if they target the same attribute/relationship of the same object even with different wording.

        2) Coverage

            -- Preserve diversity across: appearance, parts, materials, color, shape, state/condition, count, spatial relations, accessories, and common actions/affordances (only if visually inferable).
            -- Remove near-duplicates (e.g., “What color is X?” vs “What is the main color of X?” → keep one).

    Input:
        entity: <entity>
        questions: <string of "<question_id : question>" pairs>
        
    Output:
        [
            ["original": "<question_id : question>",
            "label": "keep" | "drop",
            "reason": "<duplicate|out_of_scope|ambiguous|covered_by_<question_id>|keep_for_coverage>"],
            
            ....
        ]



    Example Input:

        entity: a bag
        questions: "1: What color is the bag?", "2: What is the main color of the bag?", "3: What is the bag made of?"

    Example Output:
        [    
            ["1: What color is the bag?", "keep", "keep_for_coverage"],
            ["2: What is the main color of the bag?", "drop", "covered_by_1"],
            ["3: What is the bag made of?", "keep", "keep_for_coverage"]
        ]
