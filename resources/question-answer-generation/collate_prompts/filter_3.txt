You process one entity at a time. You are given a entity name and a list of questions. Your job is to perform a compaction pass to remove redundancy, hard-to-answer items, and limit the question-set size.

    Objectives
    - Limit to at most 15 questions; aim for 10 high-quality questions.
    - Remove or merge questions that target very similar attributes; keep one representative or suggest a single combined rewrite.
    - Drop questions that are difficult to answer reliably from a single image.

    Guiding rules (use IDs G1–G12 in “reason”)
    - G1 Size cap: Return no more than 15 questions; target 10 without losing core coverage.
    - G2 De-duplicate by attribute family: Keep one per family; merge near-duplicates.
        - Families: type/form, color, material, key parts, state (open/closed, on/off, posture), context/scene, accessories, human interaction.
    - G3 Prefer presence/absence or small closed sets. Drop fine-grained variants using the same evidence region.
    - G4 Drop view/occlusion-prone items (e.g., sunroof, detailed door mechanisms, backguard) unless they are clearly visible in most images of this entity.
    - G5 Drop time/lighting-dependent or ambiguous cues (e.g., illuminated at night, partially/fully shaded).   
    - G6 Collapse materials: keep at most one global material question; drop sub-component materials unless critical to the entity.
    - G7 Replace multiple “design/shape” questions with one concrete closed-set version, or drop if categories are not visually distinct.
    - G8 Consolidate action/posture/activity into a single, closed-set question where applicable.
    - G9 Drop niche/low-yield attributes (e.g., decorations, rare fixtures).
    - G10 Keep only one color question per object; drop secondary color details (e.g., wheel color).


    Conservatism
    Favor precision over recall: prefer questions with clear, objective visual cues; drop subjective, context-heavy, or occlusion-prone items.

    Input format

        entity: <string>
        questions: <question_id:question>


    For each question in the input list, output a list with:

        <question_id:question>
        <keep | drop | merge>
        brief rule reference (e.g., “G2/G8 merge similar attributes”)
        only if decision=merge/keep (provide rewritten question), else "None". If decision=merge: provide a single combined question that replaces the merged set; include the ID of the first merged question at the start of the rewrite (preserve its prefix).
    

    Example
    Input
    entity: “a car”
    questions:
            "1: What type of vehicle is it (sedan/SUV/other)?",
            "2: Is the car moving or stationary?",
            "3: Are the headlights on or off?",
            "4: Is a sunroof present?",
            "5: Is the car parked on a street, driveway, or in a garage?",
            "6: Is the car on a paved or unpaved surface?",
            "7: What is the primary color of the car?",
            "8: Are the wheels visible?",
            "9: What color are the wheels?"
