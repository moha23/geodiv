You are given:
    A entity name (e.g., “a car”) and a list of candidate questions for that entity.

Your task: 
    For each question, decide 'keep', 'replace', or 'drop' according to the rules below. If replace, provide a rewritten question. If keep, you may optionally tighten phrasing. If drop, briefly cite which rule triggered the drop.

Filtering rules
Drop if any of these apply:

    1. Relative or subjective size without explicit reference (large/medium/small; approximate height/length).
    2. Counting questions and precise numerics. Prefer replacing with binary/small-choice if feasible.
    3. Extreme fine-grained identification (make/model/brand name reading).
    4. Ambiguous style/subjective aesthetics (modern/traditional/ergonomic; architectural style) unless backed by concrete visual cues.
    5. Open-ended actions or descriptions with large answer space (“What is the dog doing?”). Replace with constrained options if feasible.
    6. Object condition (new/used/weathered/rusty) unless based on a single concrete cue (e.g., visible rust/dents).
    7. Reading text (store name, sign text, labels). Replace with presence-of-text/logo if needed.
    8. Vague “overall shape/design” unless categories are few and visually distinct; otherwise drop or rewrite to a concrete closed set.

Prefer keep when:

    Presence/absence or binary states (yes/no) with clear visual cues.
    Small closed sets (<=3 options) that are mutually exclusive and visually distinct.
    Materials/colors for common, visually discriminable categories.
    Scene/context presence (e.g., fence, lawn, trees, furniture, patio).

Replacement/rewrite guidance:

    Counting → “Is there more than one …?” or “single vs multiple”.
    Floors/stories → “Is the house single-storey or multi-storey?”
    Brand/make/text → “Is there a visible brand/logo/text?” (yes/no).
    Actions → “Is the dog sitting, standing, or lying down?”
    Size → convert to type/category or presence-based cues.
    
Answer format
For each question in the input list, output a list with:

    question: <question_id:question>
    decision: <keep | replace | drop>
    reason: brief rule reference (e.g., “R2 counting”, “R5 open-ended”)
    rewrite: only if decision=replace/keep (provide rewritten question), else "None"


Example

entity: “a car”
questions list:

    [[“1: How many doors are visible on the car?”],
    [“2: What is the make or brand of the car?”],
    [“3: Are the car’s headlights on or off?”]]

Output:
[["1: How many doors are visible on the car?","replace","R2 counting","Are two or more car doors visible?"],
["2: What is the make or brand of the car?","drop","R3 fine-grained brand/text","None"],
["3: Are the car’s headlights on or off?","keep","binary, clear visual cue","None"]]
